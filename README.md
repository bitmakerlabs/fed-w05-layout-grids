# Layouts & Grids

We'll start with a basic HTML document and add some grid layout to it, then we'll move on to something more complex

## Basic Grid

Setup this basic grid so that:

1. The title bar is across the top of the document
2. The logo text fits in the title bar
3. The three articles are side-by-side


## Medium

This is the basic HTML that represents the Medium Top Stories page that we just went over.

Now it's your turn to try to recreate what we did in class.
